Hello Gage here!

In the repo you should see all the requested bits and pieces of the coding test I was sent.
I implemented most of the parts (save for the final part of part IV) on the index.html file.

By opening the index.html file with whatever browser you prefer (i was using firefox and chrome)
You should be able to see and interact with the HTML SCSS and Javascript parts of the test, as well as the Train Wreck prototype from part IV.

I am including all the files I was working with on this test so you should not need to compile the scss to see the other code in action, but feel free to.

The prototype for the video quiz (second part of part IV) is in a zip included with the other files. I used the InVision app (first time trying it, it's pretty cool).

Thanks for giving the opportunity to interview for you
