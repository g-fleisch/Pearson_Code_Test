Hello Gage here!

In the repo you should see all the requested bits and pieces of the coding test I was sent.
I implemented most of the parts (save for the final part of part IV) on the index.html file.

By opening the index.html file with whatever browser you prefer (i was using firefox and chrome)
you should be able to see and interact with HTML SCSS and Javascript parts of the test.

I am including all the files I was working with on this test so you should not need to compile the scss to see the other code in action.
